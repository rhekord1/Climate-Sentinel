                        We explore Ghanaâ€™s forests and place our eagle devices in strategic points across protected areas, 
                        thereby enabling immediate intervention by responsible agents. Using AI-powered cameras and IoT sensors, 
                        we detect illegal activities such as logging and mining in real time. 
                        Our system captures evidence, triggers alerts, and logs all activity on a secure dashboard.
                         We work closely with environmental agencies and local authorities to provide verified reports that support enforcement actions and long-term forest conservation.
